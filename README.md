A place that is called Seattle Kitten Resue Service, tons of kittens that need homes. They need a website that can match perspective owners with rescue kitens. Having hundreds of kittens, they want a plave for users to find kittens and get info about those kittens and make desciisions based on information that the SKR has. 

- As the pet owner, I would like a profile of kittens that SKR has rescued.
  - Personality Traits
  - Name
  - Breed
  - Image of the cat
  - Health History 
- As the rescue service 
  - Who is adopting
    - Name
    - Age
    - Pet history as an owner
    - Address 

Out of Scope
- Removing kittens from a list
- Social Media
- No Videos

## Specific Taks to Complete
- Dispaly a list of cats that need adopting
- Create a form for adding cats to our list
- Create a form for perspective cat owners
